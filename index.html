    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Computational Design is a full-year introductory computer science elective course that teaches students to collaboratively deepen their understanding of computer science through design thinking and making. Students will dissect computers, write programs in JavaScript, build physical computational devices with Arduinos, and explore web design. This course is open to students in grades 10-12. Students in grade 10 are encouraged to enroll in AP Computer Science Principles in grade 11 and in doing so will meet their requirement for a second year of art. Students with interest in computer science and technology are encouraged to apply. No prior experience is required.</p>
