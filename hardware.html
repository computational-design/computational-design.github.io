    <h2>Hardware</h2>

    <p>	The Hardware unit is meant to teach the basic functions of the components in a computer. In this unit, our class disassembled various devices to learn what hardware was needed for each device. We took apart different models of iphones, laptops, and a desktop. As we took out the components, we discussed what we thought each piece was. We then looked up the actual answer to see if we were correct. By taking apart different models, we learned about the progression of each component as technology evolves. This unit also gave insight into the companies that produce hardware. Our final project for this unit was a videogame which included the definitions and pictures of common components in laptops, iPhones, and Desktop PCs. You can find it linked below the images.
