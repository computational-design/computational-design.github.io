    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p> The purpose of the programming unit is to teach students how to start coding on Khan Academy in Java Script. The material was learned through videos in Khan Academy and by Ms. Brandon through classwork. Students first created self portraits using their basic knowledge of creating shapes. They also coded moving backgrounds with functions and variables, and finally a final project which combined all that they had learned. The final project consisted of a video game that the students planned, designed, and tested. This unit of the Computational Design course was from October 25th to November 19th.
